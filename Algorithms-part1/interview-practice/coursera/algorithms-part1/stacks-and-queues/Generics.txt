Question 3: Java generics
Explain why Java prohibits generic array creation.

Java generics are a compile time only type check. The type is "erased" during
compilation and a result the runtime does not know what type a generic object is.
Creating a generic array would mean the runtime cannot know the type of the array.
This would mean the runtime cannot perform type safety checks. This is not a
problem for other generic objects since they have their base type.

ArrayList<String> has the same type as ArrayList<Int>
