Question 1: Intersection of two sets
Given two arrays a[] and b[], each containing N distinct 2D points in the plane,
design a subquadratic algorithm to count the number of points that are contained
both in array a[] and array b[].


Solution:

class Point {
  private int x;
  private int y;
}

Duplicate points can be detected by comparing the x and y coordinates of each
points. A brute force approach would involve checking each point in a[] against
each other point in b[]. This requires O(N^2) time, which does not meet the
requires.

A more optimal solution sorts the two arrays by their coordinates (x then y).
After sorting, a linear scan over each array simultaneously will allow
duplicates to be detected. The iteration requires only incrementing the position
within the array with the smallest point.

Alternatively, the arrays would be concatenated and sorted. Then, duplicate
points will be sorted next to each other.
